- [x] **Tank Scoring** - 0-100% compatibility score with detailed breakdown
- [x] **Conflict Detection** - Identifies incompatible pairs with reasons

### Technical Features
- [x] **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first, works on all screen sizes
- [x] **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, semantic structure
- [x] **Performance** - Optimized components, efficient filtering algorithms

## 🚧 In Progress

### Species Information System
- [x] Quick Facts component (10 key facts per species)
- [x] Detailed species information display
- [ ] Individual species pages with full information
- [ ] Species comparison tool

## 📋 Next Priority (Pending)

### Tank Management
- [ ] **Tank Mate Recommendation Engine** - Smart suggestions based on selected species
- [ ] **Current Tank Setup Analyzer** - Check if new species can be added to existing tank
- [ ] **Tank Builder** - Visual tank composition with equipment recommendations

### E-commerce Integration
- [ ] **BigCommerce Catalyst Integration** - Connect to product catalog
- [ ] **Product Recommendation System** - Equipment suggestions for new/existing setups
- [ ] **Product Filtering** - Filter by species compatibility, tank size, budget

### AI Features
- [ ] **Stealth Mode Guided Assistant** - Contextual, non-intrusive suggestions
- [ ] **Behavioral Tracking** - Learn from user browsing patterns
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal relevant information gradually

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Swiper.js Integration** - Interactive carousels and galleries
- [ ] **Advanced Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Bundle splitting, image optimization

### Deployment
- [ ] **GitHub Repository Setup** - Version control and collaboration
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment** - Production deployment with CI/CD

## 📊 Progress Metrics

### Completion Status
- **Core Architecture**: 100% ✅
- **Species System**: 90% 🔄
- **Compatibility Engine**: 100% ✅
- **UI Components**: 70% 🔄
- **E-commerce Integration**: 0% ⏳
- **Stealth Assistant**: 0% ⏳
- **Deployment**: 0% ⏳

### Technical Debt
- Need to expand species database with remaining chart species
- Missing BigCommerce Catalyst patterns integration
- Stealth assistant architecture needs design
- Product schema needs definition

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Accurate Compatibility System** - Successfully parsed 31-species compatibility matrix
2. **Real-time Analysis** - Instant compatibility feedback as users select species
3. **Scalable Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns, reusable components
4. **Performance First** - Efficient algorithms, optimized React patterns
5. **Accessibility Ready** - Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## 🔄 Current Sprint Focus

**Week 1**: Complete species information system and tank recommendation engine
- Finish individual species pages
- Build tank mate suggestion algorithm
- Implement tank setup analyzer

**Week 2**: BigCommerce integration and product recommendations
- Connect to Catalyst backend
- Build product recommendation engine
- Implement equipment suggestion system

## 📝 Notes

- All components stay under 200 lines as requested
- Following BigCommerce Catalyst best practices
- Maintaining semantic HTML structure
- Using only Tailwind v3.4.17 utilities
- Open Sans font implemented throughout
- Color scheme: Aqua (#06a9db) and Coral (#ff5722) with proper contrast
