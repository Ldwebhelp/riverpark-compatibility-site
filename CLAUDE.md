### Environment Configuration:
- BigCommerce Store Hash: `nzocnvfw4r`
- Storefront API configured with valid tokens
- Production deployment: https://riverpark-compatibility-site-mwvvo2i4r.vercel.app

## Key Issues Identified:
1. **Species Database**: Only 2 species implemented, need 29+ more with complete compatibility matrix
2. **No Real Product Data**: Sample products in place but need real BigCommerce product integration
3. **Limited Functionality**: Core features like compatibility checker need implementation
4. **Missing Content**: No species images, incomplete descriptions, placeholder content

## Next Priority Tasks:
1. Complete species database with all freshwater fish data
2. Implement functional compatibility checker interface
3. Connect real BigCommerce product data to existing UI
4. Add species images and complete care guides
5. Build working tank setup analyzer with bioload calculations

## Recent UI Improvements (Latest Session):
- âœ… **Complete Frontend Redesign**: Modern eCommerce layout with freshwater theme
- âœ… **Product Detail Pages**: Dynamic routing with comprehensive 2-column layout
- âœ… **Semantic HTML**: Full accessibility compliance with proper structure
- âœ… **Stock Management**: Dynamic badges and real-time stock indicators
- âœ… **Navigation Enhancement**: Removed emoji icons, clean professional design
- âœ… **ProductModal Removal**: Replaced with dedicated product pages for better UX
- âœ… **Sticky Sidebar**: Right column stays fixed during full page scroll

## Deployment Status:
- âœ… GitHub: https://github.com/Ldwebhelp/riverpark-compatibility-site
- âœ… Vercel Production: Live with modern eCommerce UI and product navigation
- âœ… Environment Variables: Configured and encrypted
- ðŸ”„ User-Ready: Modern UI complete, needs content and core functionality

## Technical Achievements:
- **Zero TypeScript Errors**: Clean compilation across all components
- **Bundle Optimization**: Efficient code splitting and lazy loading
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards met
- **Performance**: Optimized images, proper caching, fast page loads
- **SEO Ready**: Semantic structure and meta tags in place
