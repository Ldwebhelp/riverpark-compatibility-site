# Claude Code Session Progress

## Project: Riverpark Aquarium Compatibility Guide

### Current Status: ~30% Complete (Foundation Built, Content & Functionality Needed)

## ✅ Completed Foundation Work:
- **Project Structure**: Next.js 14.2.15 with TypeScript and App Router
- **Build System**: Proper TypeScript compilation, zero errors
- **Component Architecture**: Responsive components with accessibility features

- **BigCommerce Integration**: API framework with live credentials configured
- **Version Control**: Clean Git history with proper commit messages
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 with Open Sans font
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant features and screen reader support

## 🔄 Critical Missing Work (70% remaining):

### Database & Content
- [ ] Complete species database - add remaining 29+ species with full compatibility data
- [ ] Fill out complete compatibility matrix for all species pairs  
- [ ] Add detailed species information (care requirements, tank params, etc.)
- [ ] Implement species images/photos instead of emoji placeholders

### Core Functionality  
- [ ] Create functional species selector component with search and filtering
- [ ] Build working compatibility checker that shows actual results
- [ ] Implement functional tank mate recommendations engine
- [ ] Create working tank setup analyzer with bioload calculations

### BigCommerce Integration
- [ ] Add real BigCommerce product data and categories
- [ ] Test and validate BigCommerce API endpoints and integration
- [ ] Implement product recommendation system with real product matching

### User Experience
- [ ] Build functional stealth assistant with contextual suggestions
- [ ] Add proper error handling and loading states throughout app
- [ ] Create functional navigation between all pages
- [ ] Add user feedback and validation for form inputs

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Implement responsive design testing across devices
- [ ] Add content management for species descriptions and care guides
- [ ] Create help documentation and user guides
- [ ] Test end-to-end user workflows and fix bugs
- [ ] Performance optimization and production readiness

```

### Environment Configuration:
- BigCommerce Store Hash: `nzocnvfw4r`
- Storefront API configured with valid tokens
- Production deployment: https://riverpark-compatibility-site-mwvvo2i4r.vercel.app

## Key Issues Identified:
1. **Species Database**: Only 2 species implemented, need 29+ more with complete compatibility matrix
2. **No Real Product Data**: BigCommerce framework exists but no actual products configured
3. **Non-functional Components**: UI components built but missing data connections
4. **Missing Content**: No species images, incomplete descriptions, placeholder content

## Next Priority Tasks:
1. Complete species database with all freshwater fish data
2. Implement functional compatibility checker interface
3. Add real BigCommerce product catalog
4. Build working tank setup analyzer
5. Test end-to-end user workflows

## Deployment Status:
- ✅ GitHub: https://github.com/Ldwebhelp/riverpark-compatibility-site
- ✅ Vercel Production: Live but not functional for end users
- ✅ Environment Variables: Configured and encrypted
- ❌ User-Ready: Needs substantial content and functionality work
